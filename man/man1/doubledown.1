.SH "NAME"
\fBdoubledown\fR \- sync local changes to a remote directory
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBdoubledown\fR [\fB\-i\fR \fIidentity\fR] \fIlocal\fR [\fIuser\fR@]\fIserver\fR:\fIremote\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBdoubledown\fR brings \fIlocal\fR and \fIremote\fR on \fIserver\fR into sync and then executes doubledown\-fsevents(1) to watch \fIlocal\fR for changes\.
.
.P
An ssh\-agent(1) is started if one cannot be found\. Because \fBdoubledown\fR will connect to \fIserver\fR many times over its life, you must use an SSH key pair to authenticate\. If you have not created an SSH key pair, do so with the following commands:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

ssh\-keygen \-t rsa \-b 2048 \-f $HOME/\.ssh/id_rsa
ssh <server> "echo $(cat $HOME/\.ssh/id_rsa\.pub) >\.ssh/authorized_keys"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
When \fBdoubledown\fR is run, rsync(1) is used to first download all files in \fIremote\fR on \fIserver\fR that do not exist in \fIlocal\fR, thus no local changes will be clobbered\. It then uploads any local changes\. Finally, it executes doubledown\-fsevents(1)\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR \fIidentity\fR
Use a non\-standard identity (private key)\. Analogous to the \fB\-i\fR option to \fBssh\fR(1)\.
.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
