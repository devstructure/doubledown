doubledown(1) -- sync local changes to a remote directory
=========================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`doubledown` [`-i` _identity_] _local_ [_user_@]_server_:_remote_

## DESCRIPTION

`doubledown` brings _local_ and _remote_ on _server_ into sync and then executes doubledown-fsevents(1) to watch _local_ for changes.

An ssh-agent(1) is started if one cannot be found.  Because `doubledown` will connect to _server_ many times over its life, you must use an SSH key pair to authenticate.  If you have not created an SSH key pair, do so with the following commands:

	ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
	ssh <server> "echo $(cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) >>.ssh/authorized_keys"

When `doubledown` is run, rsync(1) is used to first download all files in _remote_ on _server_ that do not exist in _local_, thus no local changes will be clobbered.  It then uploads any local changes.  Finally, it executes doubledown-fsevents(1).

## OPTIONS

* `-i` _identity_:
  Use a non-standard identity (private key).  Analogous to the `-i` option to `ssh`(1).
* `-h`, `--help`:
  Show a help message.

## SEE ALSO

`doubledown` was written to make it easier for DevStructure users to use Textmate and other IDEs but it's far from the only way to skin the cat.

doubledown-fsevents(1) watches a directory and relays changes.  It is called by `doubledown`.
